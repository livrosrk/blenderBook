# Some useful Shorcuts

## Set current viewport view to activate camera view

- Original is `Align Camera to View` and is something with shift + numpad 0, but this does not work on my laptop, so I set it to `ctrl + shift  + m`

## Shift - s 
- Opens the 3-Cursor menu. You can place the 3d-cursor then where you want it to

## alt + middle mouse

- Select an object and hit alt + mouse. It will put the pivot point? there (it will essentially zoom to that object...)
